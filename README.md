# BikeShare Analysis

### Description
In this project, I utilize python to analyze information collected by Motivate, a bike share system provider. The three cities being analyzed are Chicago, Washington, and New York City. They share six columns of data, which are Start Time, End Time, Trip Duration, Start Station, End Station, and User Type. Chicago and New York City also contain columns on Gender and Birth Year of the users. The analysis are on popular times of travel, popular stations, trip durations, and counts on user info.

### Files Used
I used three CSV files for the data on the three cities which were named chicago.csv, washington.csv, and new_york_city.csv and a template file named bikeshare.py which I did my work on. The template file used comments to give instructions on how to navigate the project.
